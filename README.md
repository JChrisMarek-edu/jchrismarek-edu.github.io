# Chris's Code Corner
Hello, I am J. Chris Marek I like to work on code that challenges me. I primarily code at night as I am generally a night owl. I like to work on code for video games. In my free time lately (which is little) I am working on code for a 2d Rogue-like game being built in Unity. Once I discuss it with the rest of the team I may post my code on this GitHub repository as well. I am an undergraduate student at Seattle Pacific University majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Data Analytics. My Academic Advisor is Dr. Arias Arevalo.
